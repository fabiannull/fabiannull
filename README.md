# ðŸ’« About Me:
<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Fabian.</h1><br><h3 align="center">If i'm not riding my bike or go kitesurfing, i'm writing code and i ðŸ’“ it!</h3><br><br>- ðŸŒ± Constant learning is the key to be a happy developer! So i learn everything my project needs.<br><br>- ðŸ“« / ðŸ’¬ How to reach me: fabian.dev@outlook.de <br><br>- âš¡ Fun fact: You surely know the number pi. As pi is infinite, every imaginable and unimaginable number combination is included in the number pi. Since images also consist only of 0 and 1, there is an image of you in the number pi as you are currently looking at my profile. Crazy, isn't it? Similarly, there is an image of you hiring me in your company. ;)

# ðŸ“Š GitHub Stats:

I know you're expecting to see a super fancy portfolio here. Currently, I'm working on a system that documents elevator inspections. With a 40+ hour job, my free time outside of work is rather limited, especially with a dog that wants to go to the woods and a bike that shouldn't collect dust in the cellar. I'm working on it, but if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. So it's not completely empty, here are a few very old projects for practice.

my old projects:

- live demo vue todo-app https://vue-todo-app02.netlify.app
- live demo vue term calendar https://vue-terminkalender.netlify.app/
